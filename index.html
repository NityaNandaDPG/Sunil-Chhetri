      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Sunil Chhetri was born on 3rd August, 1984 to Nepalese parents at a place called Secunderabad , Andhra Pradesh . [19] [20] His mother and two sisters played football for the Nepal women's team. [21] Perhaps this is the reason why he was interested in football since childhood. His father worked as a Gurkha jawan in the Indian Army and was transferred very quickly but this did not make any difference to Sunil. He had only become crazy about football.</p>
